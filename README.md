## Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is a simple game based on the graphical user interface, where the first player, X or O, according to the random selection, clicks on one of the squares to document the turn, then it is the turn of the other player, and when 3 squares are equal in a longitudinal, transverse or diagonal way, the player wins.
